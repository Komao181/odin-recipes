        <!-- Description -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gotong Batangas is a rich and flavorful beef stew that hails from Batangas, a province in the Philippines. Unlike traditional rice-based "goto," this version is all about the beefy goodness, using various parts of the cow, such as tripe and innards, simmered in a savory broth. The dish is hearty and comforting, often enjoyed with a side of rice and spiced with chili for an extra kick.</p>
        <p>This dish is perfect for those who love a bold, meaty flavor and appreciate traditional Filipino comfort food with a regional twist.</p>
