# odin-recipes
## my first odin project
Welcome to my simple HTML webpage! This project showcases my foundational skills and understanding of HTML, covering essential tags, structure, and formatting techniques. You'll find examples of organized content, headers, lists, links, images, and other core HTML elementsâ€”all crafted to create a clean and readable layout. This page serves as a starting point in my journey toward mastering web development fundamentals.
